Playable in local with 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 mode.

Playable online, with a game history and a mode replay for being better at the next game.

The online is reserved to connected users.

You needed NodeJS and MySQL or MariaDB.

log into your MySQL/MariaDB server and import database.sql in your new
database created.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Upgrades

it lacks options, like the possibility of playing with 5x5 and 7x7 modes in multiplayer. The server already manages these game modes, but it is on the game search that the details are missing.

What it also misses, it is in the reading of the replay, to be able to read action by action rather than to see all being displayed in a blow as currently.
